For this project I used a starter template for Next.js obtained from the tutorial available at nextjs.org. 

This project represents a simple proof of concept where I used the Next.js framework and added a React frontend. 

There's a search bar that provides live reloading. Dynamic routing is also
available for each of the drink recipes. Recipes are fetched from this free API:
